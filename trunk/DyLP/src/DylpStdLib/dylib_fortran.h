/*
  A note about string handling in mixed code. C goes by the convention that
  strings are terminated by a '\0' character, and padded with '\0' on the
  rare occasions when padding is necessary. Fortran, on the other hand, keeps
  an explicit (though hidden) length, and pads with ' '. The two forms are
  just not compatible. Take care when passing strings back and forth. Adding
  an explicit null in the Fortran definition of the string is your best bet.
  The output routines in io.c and errs.c expect this, and do not make use of
  the 'hidden' parameter giving the string length.
*/

/*
  Some macros to help with Fortran arrays. 2-D arrays should simply be declared
  as array[rows*cols], and let the macro take care of the rest. This avoids
  complications due to column-major order in Fortran vs. row-major order in C.

  NOTE that these macros assume you are using the Fortran indexing convention,
  which starts at 1.

/*
  These codes are used by the Fortran part of the code to identify arguments
  supplied to errmsg_, warn_, and outfmt_. The Fortran code sees them from
  the common block argcod_, which is initialised in errs.c:errinit (from the
  io library. Do not rearrange the structure declaration without making
  corresponding changes in the Fortran common block.

  The codes ftnargVARNAME and ftnargCONNAME are peculiar to the bonsai MILP
  program (which prompted the development of the Fortran interface for i/o
  and error messages) and likely of little use in other contexts. At best,
  modifications to the routines in errs.c and io.c are required to support
  them.
