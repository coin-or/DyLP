  This file contains the structure definitions required to use the bnf reader
  package. The bnf reader depends heavily on the following two assumptions:

  * There is some pointer type into which any other pointer can be cast and
    recovered.
  
  * An int can be cast into a pointer and recovered. This is used to prevent
    the complexity of the bnf data structure from getting out of hand, but
    could be avoided at the expense of a substantial increase in its size and
    awkwardness of use.

  The basic scheme is something like this. At the bottom, we have a number of
  terminal constructs: immediates, literals, terminals, and labels of various
  flavours. Above these are the three non-terminal constructs: primitives,
  non-primitives, and generators. The non-terminals have bodies which are made
  up of references to other terminal or non-terminal constructs. Generator
  bodies have only one parse; primitive and non-primitive bodies can have a
  number of alternative parses. A picture is probably in order here:

  definition      body

  ----------      ----------	  ----------      ----------
  |        | ---> |        | ---> |  ref   | ---> |  defn  |
  ----------      ----------      ----------      ----------
		  |  ....  |
		  ----------	  ----------      ----------
		  |        | ---> |  ref   | ---> |  defn  |
		  ----------	  ----------      ----------

  A definition contains a pointer to its body, which is an array of pointers to
  references. Each reference points to a definition. Essentially, a reference
  specifies how the second definition is to be used in the context of the body
  of the first definition.

  The bnf reader has the capability to create arbitrary links in the data
  structure it's building. Some terminology will make things easier:

  		|  ....  |
  		----------      ----------
      socket -->| label -+----->|        |
  		----------      ----------
  		|  ....  |      |  ....  |

  The value of a label is the address of something. To make a link, the
  value of the label has to be stored.  The place where it is stored is
  called a socket. The value of a socket is the address of the field where
  the value of the label is stored. When it defines a socket, the bnf reader
  associates a name with an address; similarly for a label. Both socket and
  label references cause a label to be stored in a socket; the difference
  between the two lies in which of the socket or label can be undefined when
  the reference is processed.

  When it's not important to distinguish between sockets and labels, the
  documentation uses label to include both.
  
  To write a bnf, you use the set of macros defined at the end of
  the file. For a detailed explanation of the sorts of things that can be
  specified with the bnf, the user should take a look at the supplementary
  documentation. The structures and code will make a lot more sense afterward.

/*
  Data structures used for bnf definitions. There are three types of things
  here: individual structures for the various definition types, a common
  structure which consists only of the fields common to all of the individual
  structures, and a pointer union which is handy when walking around in a bnf.

  Just to keep the explanation in hand a bit, let's define components and
  alternatives. The body of a bnf definition consists of alternatives
  (alternative parses), each of which has a number of components. A component
  array is an array of pointers to bnf reference structures, each of which in
  turn references a bnf definition structure. An alternative array is an array
  of pointers to component arrays. I know this is ugly and involves a lot of
  dereferencing but it seems to be the only way to handle the variable lengths
  involved. 

  NOTE: To keep things from getting completely out of hand, the first entry in
	a component or alternative array specifies the number of pointers that
	follow. This is one of the (ab)uses of the int - pointer - int cast.
