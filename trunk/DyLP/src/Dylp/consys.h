  This header file contains declarations for a constraint system data
  structure, tailored for LP-based branch-and-cut MILP algorithms (more
  generally, for any situation where dynamic change in the number of rows
  and/or columns is expected). The constraint system allows for arbitrary
  additions and deletions. Additional space is allocated as needed; there are
  no a priori limits. Allocated space is never reduced, however, short of
  destroying the constraint system.

  The coefficient matrix is implemented as a sparse structure, linked by row
  and by column. Access to the rows and columns of the coefficient matrix is
  via utility routines.
  
  To provide O(1) cost for row and column addition and deletion, while
  maintaining a dense index set, the hole left by deleting a row or column
  is filled by moving the last row or column to occupy the vacant index slot.

  The client can 'attach' row and column vectors to the constraint system;
  more precisely, vectors and multiple pointers to those vectors.  The
  vectors will be dynamically resized and pointers updated whenever rows
  or columns are added to the constraint system. Entries in attached vectors
  are automatically reordered when a row or column is moved to fill the hole
  left by a deletion.

  The user is expected to work directly with any attached vectors; there are
  no special access routines.

  Because rows and columns can move, clients must be careful when they keep
  records of row or column indices, and update these records as necessary.

  A special set of attached vectors are referred to as associated vectors.
  These are distinguished only by having pointers allocated in the constraint
  system header structure.

  NOTE: The package assumes that variables and constraints are indexed from
	1; this makes error checking a lot more reliable, particularly for
	errors of omission (whoops, forgot to set that index ... ). Vectors
	intended for expanded rows or columns must be sized accordingly.
	(I.e., if vector is to hold k values, the actual allocated space
	is k+1 entries, with vector[0] unused.) consys will do this
	automatically when asked to allocate space. Clients must remember
	this when allocating space for vectors that they will attach to a
	constraint system.

  NOTE: The constraint system is prepared to deal with both finite (most
	often DBL_MAX) and infinite (IEEE) infinity in the upper and lower
	bounds vectors for variables (vlb, vub). Explicit checks are
	necessary to maintain the value of a finite infinity when scaling the
	constraint system. The value of infinity must be supplied as a
	parameter to create_consys(). It's not a good idea to have infinity
	popping up elsewhere, but IEEE infinity should work (because no
	explicit checks are required for mathematical correctness).

  NOTE: At the infinitesimal end, any coefficient with absolute value less
	than 1.0e-20 will be dropped. Currently this is hardwired (see
	consys_create). It may change if there's a need.

/*
  Attached Vectors:

  As mentioned at the top, attached vectors are automatically resized whenever
  the constraint system is resized, and reorderd to track the movement of rows
  and columns due to deletions.

  A particular subset of attached vectors are designated as associated
  vectors; a system has at most one of each type of associated vector.
  Their only distinguishing characteristic is that they occupy the dedicated
  pointers in the constraint system header:
   * objective function
   * variable type <3>
   * variable upper & lower bounds
   * right-hand-side (a.k.a. rhs or b) and rhsl (a.k.a. rhslow or blow) <1>
   * constraint type
   * upper & lower bounds for constraint left-hand-sides <2>
   * row and column scaling vectors (more accurately, the diagonal elements
     of row and column scaling matrices)
   
   <1> rhsl is created when range constraints (blow <= ax <= b) are present
       in the constraint system.
   <2> These are calculated using the upper and lower bounds on the variables
       in the constraint, and are used in arc consistency calculations. See
       further explanation below.
   <3> Arguably the variable type vector only needs to cover the architectural
       variables, but it'd be a pain to distinguish a resize involving the
       architectural columns from a resize involving the logical columns.
       Easier to waste a little space.

  The flags given below are used in attached vector headers to indicate
  how a vector should be handled, and in the consys_struct.parts field to
  indicate which components of the constraint system are present. Their
  most important function is to specify whether a vector is a row vector
  or a column vector. Beyond that, they serve as weak consistency and type
  checks.
  
  Notes:
  * MTX, ROWHDR, and COLHDR cannot be allocated/deallocated, but having
    codes for them makes the interface to some of the utility routines a
    bit more uniform.
  * COL and ROW should be used for generic column and row vectors,
    respectively.
  * VUB is initialised to +infinity.
  * RSCALE and CSCALE are initialised to 1.0
  * VTYP and CTYP are tied to the vartyp_enum and contyp_enum types.

/*
  Constraint bounds

  Constraint bounds are upper and lower bounds on the value of the
  left-hand-side of a constraint, calculated using the upper and lower bounds
  on variables. In the case where all variables have finite bounds, the
  constraint bound will also be finite, and things are straightforward. But
  there's a complication --- we'll want to be able to efficiently handle the
  case where all variables have finite bounds except one, x<t>. In this case
  we can calculate a finite bound for the free variable, using the bounds on
  the other variables. Bottom line is we need a structure that keeps count of
  the number of infinities, as well as the finite portion of the bound. See
  consistency.c for more about the mechanics of particular cases.

  The interpretation of an entry is as follows:
    -varcnt <= inf < 0	inf is the negative of the index of the single
			remaining variable contributing an infinity; bnd is
			the finite lhs bound calculated from the other
			variables of the constraint
    inf >= 0		inf is the number of variables contributing infinity
			to the bound; bnd is the value of the finite portion
			of the lhs bound. If inf == 0, the lhs bound is finite.

    inf < -varcnt and inf = 1 are invalid. A value which exceeds the number of
    variables in the constraint is also bogus.

  This encoding means that it's impossible to distinguish +inf and -inf just
  by looking at the bound. But, in the case of constraint bounds, this hasn't
  been a problem in practice. Lower bounds go to -inf, and upper bounds go to
  +inf, and context has been sufficient.

  The revs field is used to keep track of the number of times the bound has
  been revised. See milp.h:mipopts_struct for the recalculation frequency.

      the objective function. The other use for non-binding constraints is
      in rows of type Dx (x one of N, E, G, or L), which specify linear
      combinations of constraints.
  <2> Following OSL (a good lead to follow when they're going where I want to
      go  :-), bonsai doesn't accept Dx rows, and throws away all but the
      first non-binding constraint, which it keeps only if it needs it for
      the objective function.
