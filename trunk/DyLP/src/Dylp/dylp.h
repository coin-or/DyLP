  This file contains definitions related to dylp, a subroutine library which
  implements a dynamic (primal-dual) linear programming algorithm based on
  the algorithm described by Padberg in Linear Optimisation & Extensions,
  Springer-Verlag, 1995.  dylp also owes a debt to previous and contemporary
  codes the author has worked with --- la05, bandbx, zoom/xmp, ylp, and glpk.

  At minimum, dylp requires only a constraint system. Since it manages a
  dynamically sized private copy of the constraint system while solving the
  LP, there's no point in having the client attach logical variables (they'd
  just get in the way, really).

  dylp will accept a basis specification. This takes the form of a status
  vector giving the status of all variables, and a basis vector specifying
  the active constraints and their associated basic variables. From this
  dylp will construct an initial active problem which consists of exactly
  the given constraints and basic variables, with the logicals for the
  constraints making up the nonbasic partition.

  dylp returns as a solution the simplex termination code, the objective
  value (or related value, appropriate for the termination code), status for
  all variables, the active constraints, and the associated primal and dual
  variables (put a little differently, a basis, the values of the basic
  variables, and the dual variables associated with the active constraints).

  The conditional compilation flag DYLP_INTERNAL is used to delimit definitions
  that should be considered internal to dylp. Don't define this flag in a
  client.

  A few words on notation. Traditional matrix and vector notation for LP
  suffers a bit when limited to ascii text, but it's readable if you're
  familiar with the original. The notation in the comments and code is
  loosely based on Chvatal, "Linear Programming", W.H. Freeman, 1983, which
  the author happens to like.

  A matrix is represented with a capital letter, e.g., B. A vector is
  represented with a small letter, e.g., x. A subscript is given in angle
  brackets, e.g., x<j> for the jth coefficient of x. An individual element of
  a matrix has two subscripts, e.g., a<i,j> for the element in row i, column
  j. Column and row vectors are shown with one subscript, e.g., a<j> for the
  jth column (or row).  Whether the vector is supposed to be a column or a
  row should generally be clear from context. A capital letter in the
  subscript position indicates a set of elements, e.g., x<N> is the non-basic
  variables.

  The inverse of a matrix is denoted inv(*), e.g., the basis inverse,
  inv(B).  The dot product of two vectors is denoted dot(*,*), e.g.,
  dot(c,x), or sometimes just written directly, e.g., cx.

  The system of constraints is assumed to be Ax <= b, with m rows and n
  columns. Once the logical variables (aka slacks and artificials) have been
  added, it becomes Ax = b.  A is the constraint matrix, x is the vector of
  primal variables, and b is the right-hand-side (rhs).  NOTE that the
  convention for indices is NOT the usual one. Logical variables are assigned
  indices 1..m and architectural variables are assigned indices m+1..m+n. It
  makes for more efficient addition/deletion of variables; see consys.h for a
  little more explanation.

  There is an objective function z = cx, where z is the objective value and c
  is the vector of coefficients.  dylp minimises the objective.
  
  The matrix A is partitioned into the set of basic columns B, and the set of
  non-basic columns N (sometimes A<N>). The corresponding partitions of c and
  x are c<B>, x<B>, and c<N>, x<N>.

  Premultiplication by the basis inverse (e.g., inv(B)a<j>) is referred to as
  an `ftran'; postmultiplication (e.g., c<B>inv(B)) as a `btran'.  Quantities
  that have been transformed using the basis inverse are often (but not
  always) renamed as 'barred' quantities.

  The basic primal variables are x<B> = inv(B)b.  The dual variables are y =
  c<B>inv(B).  The jth column of A, premultiplied by inv(B), is abar<j> =
  inv(B)a<j>. The reduced costs are cbar = c<N> - c<B>inv(B)N = c<N>-yN.

  The variable i is used as a row index, j as a column index. Often they will
  represent the entering primal variable (j) and the leaving primal variable
  (i). Be aware that comments are often written as if the leaving primal
  variable x<i> occupies row i of the basis. This simplifies the writing.
  But keep in mind that variable x<i> can occupy an arbitrary row k of the
  basis.

  Termination codes for dy_primal and dy_dual, the top level routines of the
  dylp simplex algorithms. Also used by various internal routines.  Codes
  marked with (*) will never be returned to the client unless dylp has
  failed.

  lpINV         The code is not valid (i.e., not set by an execution of
		dy_primal or dy_dual).

  lpOPTIMAL	The problem has an optimal solution.

  lpUNBOUNDED	The problem is unbounded.

  lpSWING(*)	The problem is pseudo-unbounded: Some primal variable grew
		excessively in a single pivot.

  lpINFEAS	The problem is infeasible.

  lpACCCHK	An accuracy check failed and dylp's internal recovery
		algorithms could not recover the situation.

  lpSTALLED	The problem has been abandoned due to stalling. (We could
		in fact actually be cycling, but that's too much trouble
		to prove.)

  lpITERLIM	The problem has been abandoned because it has exceeded an
		absolute iteration limit.

  lpNOSPACE     The problem has been abandoned because the basis package did
		not have sufficient space to maintain the basis.

  lpLOSTFEAS	Feasibility was lost during simplex execution.

  lpPUNT	The lp has punted because it ran into a pivoting problem.

		The next three codes indicate that we're in the middle of
		attempting a forced transition for error recovery purposes.

  lpFORCEDUAL(*) Force a primal to dual transition.

  lpFORCEPRIMAL(*) Force a dual to primal transition.

  lpFORCEFULL(*) Force all inactive constraints and variables to be loaded.

  lpFATAL	Fatal confusion or error of some sort; covers a multitude
		of sins.

  The dual simplex routine does not have a phase I routine equivalent to
  dy_primal1 for the primal simplex. (In the context of dylp, it expects
  to run after dy_primal has been used to find an initial optimal solution.)

  When using the dual simplex method, internal codes reflect the state of
  the dual problem, but dy_dual makes the usual translation back to the
  primal problem, as:

  The main loop states (dyPRIMAL1 -- dyFORCEFULL) must remain a contiguous
  block. dy_dumpstats counts on dyPRIMAL1 and dyFORCEPRIMAL being first and

  dyDONE must remain the last code --- it's used to dimension a statistics

  Variable status codes

  dylp keeps explicit status for both basic and nonbasic variables. These are
  set up as flags so that it's easy to test when more than one status will do
  for a particular action.

  vstatBFX	basic, fixed
  vstatBUUB	basic, above upper bound
  vstatBUB	basic, at upper bound
  vstatB	basic, strictly between bounds (a well-behaved basic variable)
  vstatBLB	basic, at lower bound
  vstatBLLB	basic, below lower bound
  vstatBFR	basic, free (unbounded)

  vstatNBFX	nonbasic, fixed
  vstatNBUB	nonbasic at upper bound
  vstatNBLB	nonbasic at lower bound
  vstatNBFR	nonbasic free

  vstatSB	superbasic, within bounds

  dylp ensures that superbasic variables are, in fact, always strictly within
  bounds.

  Inactive NBFR variables can be created at startup if there are free
  variables that are not selected by the basis crash to be in the initial
  basis. They can also be forced inactive by error recovery. By convention,
  NBFR variables always have a value of zero.

  Inactive SB variables should not occur. SB status occurs only as the result
  of error recovery and is only valid in primal simplex.

  The value of SB variables is lost when they are reported out as part of a
  solution. This will only happen if dylp could not find an optimal solution.

  The following qualifiers can be added to the status:

  vstatNOPIVOT	Prevents the variable from being considered as a candidate
		for pivoting; used by the pivot rejection machinery.
  vstatNOPER	Prevents the variable from being perturbed during the
		formation of a restricted subproblem.

  basis_struct

  This structure is used to describe a basis to dylp, and to return the
  final basis at termination. The size of the basis depends on the
  number of active constraints, which will be a subset of the constraints
  in the system.

  The constraint system as supplied to dylp should not have logical variables
  (dylp will create them automatically). This presents a problem if the final
  basis contains basic logical variables. In this case, vndx is set to the
  negative of the index of the constraint which spawned the logical. This
  same technique can be used on input to, for example, specify the traditional
  all-logical starting basis.

  lpprob_struct

  This structure is used to pass an LP problem into dylp and convey the
  results back to the client. The allocated size indicated in colsze and
  rowsze is assumed to be accurate.  If basis, status, x, or y are NULL, they
  will be allocated as needed. If they are non-NULL, dylp will reallocate
  them if necessary (i.e., when the actual size of the lp exceeds the
  allocated size of the vectors).

  The status vector has the following coding:
    * for nonbasic variables, the normal dylp status flags are used;
    * for basic variables, the negative of the basis index is used.
  
  There is one unavoidable problem with this scheme -- the status vector
  provides the only information about the value of nonbasic variables. This
  is adequate for all but superbasic variables and nonbasic free variables
  which are not at zero. Both of these cases are transient anomalies, created
  only when the basis package is forced to patch a singular basis, and they
  should not persist in the final solution when an optimal solution is found
  or when the problem is infeasible.  They may, however, occur in the
  solution reported for an unbounded problem if the unbounded condition is
  discovered before the nonbasic free or superbasic variable is chosen for
  pivoting.  On input, nonbasic free variables are assumed to take the value
  0, and specifying a superbasic variable is illegal.

/*
  lptols_struct

  This structure contains phase and tolerance information for the lp algorithm.

  The philosophy with respect to the separate zero and feasibility tolerances
  for primal and dual variables is that dylp uses the zero tolerance when
  calculating primal or dual variables, and the feasibility tolerance when
  checking for feasibility. This allows us to keep small values for accuracy
  in computation, but not be so fussy when it comes to feasibility.

  Field		Definition
  -----		----------
  inf		Infinity. dylp uses IEEE FP infinity, but be careful not to
		pass it to the basis package.
  zero          Zero tolerance for primal variables, and also the generic
		zero tolerance for constraint coefficients, right-hand-side
		values, etc.
  pchk		Primal accuracy check tolerance.
  pfeas		Primal feasibility check tolerance; dynamically scaled from
		zero in proportion to the 1-norm of the primal basic variables.
  pfeas_scale	Primal feasibility check tolerance multiplier. This provides
		some user-controllable decoupling of zero and pfeas.
  cost          Base zero tolerance for checks involving objective function
		coefficients, reduced costs, and related values.
  dchk		Dual accuracy check tolerance. Also used by dy_duenna to
		test for improvement in the objective.
  dfeas         Dual feasbility check tolerance; dynamically scaled from cost
		in proportion to the 1-norm of the dual variables. Acts as the
		zero tolerance for reduced costs.
  dfeas_scale	Dual feasibility check tolerance multiplier. This provides
		some user-controllable decoupling of cost and dfeas.
  pivot         Simplex pivot selection tolerance, expressed as a multiplier
		for the pivot selection tolerance used by the basis package
		when factoring the basis. (I.e., the actual pivot selection
		criteria will be to accept a simplex pivot a<i,j> if
		|a<i,j>| > lptols.pivot*basis.pivot*MAX{i}|a<i,j>|.)
  bogus		Multiplier used to identify 'bogus' values, in the range
		tol < |val| < bogus*tol for the appropriate tolerance.
  swing		Ratio used to identify excessive growth in primal variables
		(pseudo-unboundedness).
  toobig	Absolute value of primal variables which will cause dual
		multipivoting to consider primal infeasibility when selecting
		a flip/pivot sequence.
  purge		Percentage change in objective function required before
		constraint or variable purging is attempted.
  purgevar	Percentage of maximum reduced cost used to determine the
		variable purge threshold; nonbasic architectural variables
		at their optimum bound whose reduced cost exceeds
		purgevar*MAX{j}cbar<j> are purged.

  reframe	Multiplier used to trigger a reference framework reset in
		PSE pricing; reset occurs if
		  |gamma<j> - ||abar<j>||^2| > reframe*||abar<j>||^2.
		The check is made in pseupdate.
		Also used to trigger recalculation of the basis inverse row
		norms used in DSE pricing; reset occurs if
		  |rho<i> - ||beta<i>||^2| > reframe*||beta<i>||^2.
		The check is made in dseupdate.

  Finally, a macro to decide if we should snap to a value. The notion here is
  that the accuracy with which one can hit a target value depends on both the
  magnitude of the target and the distance travelled to get there. On a
  64-bit machine, IEEE FP has about 15 decimal digits of accuracy. For
  example, if we're travelling 1.0e7 and trying to hit zero, we only have 8
  decimal places of accuracy remaining. If we're within 1.0e-8, might as well
  snap to 0. In practice, there's already a bit of roundoff in any nontrivial
  calculation, so we start with the zero tolerance and scale from there.
  
  In some cases, we only know the target, so the best we can do is
  scale to it.

  The utility of this idea is highly questionable.

  lpopts_struct

  This structure is used to pass option settings to dylp. Default values are
  declared at the beginning of dy_setup.c.

  Field		Definition
  -----		----------
  context	The context in which dylp is being called. See comments
		above for cxtype_enum.
  forcecold	TRUE to force a cold start, FALSE otherwise. If set to TRUE,
		dominates warm and hot start.
  forcewarm	TRUE to force a warm start, FALSE otherwise. If set to TRUE,
		dominates hot start.
  fullsys	Forces the use of the full constraint system at all times. The
		full constraint system is loaded on startup, and all constraint
		and variable deactivation/activation is skipped. (But see the
		finpurge option below.) (Also, this will not prevent dylp
		from resorting to forced phase transitions, which typically
		involve deactivation of constraints or variables. Arguably
		this is a bad thing, and may change in the future.)
  active	Used to estimate the initial size of the dylp constraint
		system relative to the original system.
    vars	  Fraction of original variables expected to be active at
		  any time.
    cons	  Fraction of original inequalities expected to be active at
		  any time.
  initcons	Specifies how inequalities will be selected to initialize the
		active system. See extensive comments in dy_coldstart.c.
    frac	  Fraction of inequalities to be used.
    i1l		  Lower bound on angle to objective, first interval
    i1lopen	  TRUE if the bound is open.
    i1u		  Upper bound on angle to objective, first interval
    i1uopen	  TRUE if the bound is open.
    i2valid	  TRUE if the second interval is specified
    i2l		  Lower bound on angle to objective, second interval
    i2lopen	  TRUE if the bound is open.
    i2u		  Upper bound on angle to objective, second interval
    i2uopen	  TRUE if the bound is open.
  coldbasis	Code specifying the kind of basis built for a cold start. See
		comments for ibtype_enum and comments in dy_coldstart.c
  finpurge	Controls whether dylp does a final deactivation of constraints
		and/or variables. This will occur only an optimal solution is
		found, and is not suppressed by fullsys.
    cons	  TRUE to purge constraints
    vars	  TRUE to purge variables
  heroics	Controls behaviour during forced primal <-> dual transitions
    d2p		  TRUE to allow deactivation of basic architecturals, FALSE
		  to disallow. FALSE is recommended, and the default.
    p2d		  TRUE to allow deactivation of tight constraints, FALSE
		  to disallow. FALSE is recommended, and the default.
    flip	  TRUE to allow flips to regain dual feasibility, FALSE to
		  disallow. Tends to cycle; default is false.
  coldvars	If the number of active variables exceeds this value after
		a cold start, dylp will attempt to purge variables prior to
		the initial primal simplex run.
  con		Options related to constraint activation/deactivation
    actlvl	  The constraint activation strategy

		       lhs <= rhslow or lhs >= rhs
    actlim	  If non-zero, limits the number of constraints that can be
		  activated in any one call to a constraint activation
		  routine.
    deactlvl	The constraint deactivation strategy:
		  0: (normal) deactivate only inequalities i which are
		     strictly loose (i.e., slk<i> basic, not at bound).
		  1: (aggressive) normal plus inequalities which are tight
		     with y<i> = 0.
		  2: (fanatic) aggressive plus equalities with y<i> = 0
  usedual	TRUE if dual phase II is to be used to regain feasibility after
		adding constraints, FALSE to force use of primal phase I.
  addvar	If non-zero, at most this many variables will be added in
		any one pass through phase dyADDVAR.
  dualadd	Controls the types of activation allowed when adding variables
		during dual simplex.
		  0:	variable activation is disallowed
		  1:	type 1 activation (variables that will be dual feasible
			when activated into the nonbasic partition)

		       improvement.
		    2: multipivoting, select for minimum predicted
		       infeasibility.
		    3: multipivoting, select infeasibility reduction if
		       possible, otherwise maximum dual objective improvement.
    flex	  If TRUE, dylp will switch between strategies 1 and 3, using
		  strategy 1 unless primal magnitudes become too large.
    allownopiv	  If TRUE, sequences of flips with no finishing pivot will be
		  allowed. Defaults to false, very prone to cycling.
  ppsel		Options to control primal pivoting. Selection of the entering
		variable is always handled by PSE.
    strat:	  The strategy used to select the leaving variable:
		    0: standard ratio test; may use anti-degen lite
		    1: multipivoting
  factor	The LP basis will be refactored every factor iterations, in
		the absence of some compelling reason (typically error
		recovery) that forces it to occur sooner.

		     so that movement in the direction of the objective most
		     nearly lies in the hyperplane
		  3: (alignedge) break ties by examining the alignment of the
		     hyperplane which will become tight on the pivot; choose
		     so that the direction of motion defined by the entering
		     variable most nearly lies in the hyperplane.
		  4: (perpobj) break ties by examining the alignment of the
		     hyperplane which will become tight on the pivot; choose
		     so that the normal of the hyperplane is most nearly
		     aligned with the normal of the objective
		  5: (perpedge) break ties by examining the alignment of the
		     hyperplane which will become tight on the pivot; choose
		     so that the normal of the hyperplane is most nearly
		     aligned with the direction of motion
		Numeric codes are related to keywords in dy_setup.c:dy_ctlopt.
  patch		TRUE to allow the code to patch a singular basis, FALSE to

/*
  Statistics structure, used to collect information about aspects of dylp
  operation beyond simple pivot counts. The data structure definition is
  always present, but to fill it you have to define DYLP_STATISTICS.

  Field		Definition
  -----		----------
  phasecnts[dyDONE] Array with counts for number of times each phase is
		executed.
  ini_simplex	The initial simplex phase
  cons		A set of arrays with data about individual constraints.
    sze		  Allocated capacity of the arrays.
    angle	  Angle to the objective function.
    actcnt	  Number of times constraint is activated.
    deactcnt	  Number of times constraint is deactivated.
    init	  True if constraint is active in initial system.
    fin		  True if constraint is active in final system.
  vars		A set of arrays with data about individual variables.
    sze		  Allocated capacity of the arrays.
    actcnt	  Number of times variable is activated.
    deactcnt	  Number of times variable is deactivated.
  angle
    max		Maximum angle to the objective function over all constraints.
    min		Minimum angle to the objective function over all constraints.
    hist[*]	Histogram of angles of constraints to the objective function.
		There are DYSTATS_HISTBINS bins. Currently, 37 bins: 36 bins
		spanning 5 degrees of angle, and a dedicated 90 degree bin.
  
  factor	Tracks how well we're doing with respect to refactoring the
		basis.
    cnt		Number of time the basis has been refactored.
    prevpiv	Pivot count at last refactorisation.
    avgpivs	Average number of pivots between basis refactorisations.
    maxpivs	Maximum number of pivots between basis refactorisations.

  pivrej	Statistics about the pivot rejection list and punts.
    max		  maximum number of entries on the pivot rejection list
    mad		  total number of entries attributed to mad pivots
    sing	  total number of entries attributed to singular pivots
    pivtol_red	  total number of times the pivot tolerance was reduced
    min_pivtol	  the minimum pivot tolerance used
    puntcall	  total number of calls to dealWithPunt
    puntret	  total number of dyrPUNT returns recommended

  dmulti	Tracks the dual multipivot algorithm. All fields except cnt are
		totals; divide by cnt to get averages.
    flippable	  Number of flippable variables in the constraint system.
    cnt		  Total calls to dualmultiin
    cands	  Number of candidates queued for evaluation for entry
    promote	  Number of calls that resulted in promoting a sane pivot
		  over an unstable pivot.
    nontrivial	  Number of times that the initial scan and sort left
		  multiple candidates for further evaluation.
    evals	  Actual number of candidates evaluated (ftran'd column)
    flips	  Number of bound-to-bound flips performed
    pivrnk	  Index in the list of candidates of the candidate finally
		  selected for pivoting.
    maxrnk	  Maximum index selected for pivoting.

  pmulti	Tracks the primal multipivot algorithm.
    cnt		  Total calls to primalmultiin
    cands	  Number of candidates queued for evaluation to leave
    nontrivial	  Number of times that the candidate list was sorted
    promote	  Number of calls that resulted in promoting a sane pivot
		  over an unstable pivot.
  
  infeas	Statistics on resolution of infeasibility in primal phase I.
		Basically, what we're interested in tracking is the number
		of infeasible variables and the number of pivots between a
		change in the number of infeasible variables. We're interested
		in separating the case of 1 variable from 2 or more, because
		the latter requires vastly more calculation. A little care
		is required because phase I can run many times.

    prevpiv	The pivot count (tot.iters) at the previous change.
    maxcnt	The maximum number of infeasible variables encountered (this
		is not strictly monotonic, as dylp may enter phase I many
		times due to activating violated constraints).
    totpivs	The total number of pivots expended in phase I.
    maxpivs	The maximum number of pivots with no change in the number of
		feasible variables.
    chgcnt1	The number of times that the number of infeasible variables
		changed and reduced costs did not have to be recalculated
		(specifically, exactly one variable became feasible, and it
		left the basis as it did so).
    chgcnt2	The number of times that the number of infeasible variables
		changed in such a way as to require recalculation of the
		reduced costs.

  [dp]degen[*]	Array of stats for each restricted subproblem nesting level,
		with separate arrays for dual (ddegen) and primal (pdegen).
		degen[0].cnt is used to hold the maximum nesting level.
    cnt		Number of times this nesting level was entered.
    avgsiz	The average number of variables in a restricted subproblem.
		Kept by iterative update, as avg<k+1> = (avg<k>*k+size)/(k+1).
		Suffers from cumulative loss of accuracy, but it'll do for
		our purposes.
    maxsiz	The maximum number of variables in a restricted subproblem.
    totpivs	Total number of pivots at or above this nesting level.
    avgpivs	Average number of pivots at or above this nesting level.
    maxpivs	Maximum number of pivots for any one instance at or above
		this nesting level.

  tot, p1, p2, d2	Iteration and pivot counts, total and for each
			individual phase. These are copied over from
			dy_lp (lp_struct) at the end of the run, so that
			they can be printed by dumpstats.
  
  DYSTATS_MAXDEGEN is the maximum number of levels of nesting accommodated by
  antidegeneracy statistics and debugging structures. The actual algorithm
  has no inherent limitation.

  DYSTATS_HISTBINS is the number of bins for constraint angles. It should be an
  odd number. Each bin will span 180/(DYSTATS_HISTBINS-1) degrees, with the
  final bin reserved for constraints at 90 degrees. For example, a value of 37
  gives 180/(37-1) = 5 degrees per bin.

/*
  lp_struct

  This structure is the control structure for an LP problem within dylp.

  Field		Definition
  -----		----------
  phase		Current phase of the dynamic simplex algorithm.
  lpret		Return code from the most recent simplex execution.

  z		Value of the objective function (includes inactzcorr).
  inactzcorr	Correction to the objective function due to inactive variables
		with non-zero values.

  simplex	Simplex algorithm status and control
    active	  currently active or most recently completed
    next	  currently active or to be started
    init_pse	  TRUE if the PSE structures need to be reinitialised,
		  FALSE otherwise
    init_dse	  TRUE if the DSE structures need to be reinitialised,
		  FALSE otherwise
		These fields are used to determine when to update or
		reinitialise the PSE and DSE data structures. Active and next
		must be valid during the purge/gen/add variable/constraint
		cycles.

		A word on infeas and infeascnt: They are guaranteed accurate
		only immediately after initialisation and following a primal
		feasibility check.

  infeas	Total infeasibility = SUM{j} max(0,x<j>-ub<j>,lb<j>-x<j>)
  infeascnt	The number of infeasible variables; refreshed when dy_accchk
		is asked to do a primal feasibility check.

  ubnd		Substructure for information on unbounded or pseudo-unbounded
		problems.
    ndx		  The index of the variable fingered for causing unboundedness
		  or pseudo-unboundedness (swing).
    ratio	  The growth ratio.

  p1obj		The following fields relate to handling of the phase I
		objective function.
    installed	TRUE if the phase I objective is currently installed
    infcnt	Tracks the number of variables incorporated in p1obj which
		remain infeasible.
    infvars_sze	Allocated size of the infvars vector.
    infvars	Vector of indices of infeasible variables incorporated in the
		phase I objective.
    p1obj	Pointer to the phase I objective (temporary storage while
		the phase II objective is installed).
    p2obj	Pointer to the phase II objective (temporary storage while
		the phase I objective is installed).
  
		A word on pivot and iteration counts: Iteration counts tally
		iterations of the pivoting loop, successful or not. Pivot
		counts tally successful bound-to-bound or change-of-basis
		pivots. Pretty much all messages will give tot.iters, so that
		it's possible to track the progress of an LP. Iterf has an
		entirely different function -- it's tracking the accumulation
		of eta matrices in the basis representation.

  sys		Substructure for dynamic system modification status. maxcons
		and maxvars exist so that dylp can easily incorporate future
		preprocessing. loadablecons and loadablevars are the booleans
		consulted by constraint and variable activation routines.
    forcedfull	  Set to TRUE if the full system has been forced in state
		  dyFORCEFULL. This should happen at most once, so if we
		  enter dyFORCEFULL and forcedfull == TRUE, it's fatal.
    maxcons	  Maximum possible number of constraints that can be activated.
    loadablecons  If FALSE, there are no constraints to activate.
    maxvars	  Maximum possible number of variables that can be activated.
    loadablevars  If FALSE, there are no constraints to activate.

  tot		Total simplex iterations and pivots, all phases
    iters
    pivs
  p1		Primal phase I iterations and pivots.
    iters
    pivs
  p2		Primal phase II iterations and pivots.
    iters
    pivs
  d2		Dual phase II iterations and pivots.
    iters
    pivs

  pivok		Set to TRUE in dy_{primal|dual}pivot if the current iteration
		is a  successful pivot. Cleared to FALSE at the head of
		dy_duenna.
  prev_pivok	Set to pivok at head of dy_duenna. Provides status of just
		completed pivot for post-Duenna decisions.

  basis		Various fields related to basis change, refactoring, etc.

    etas	The number of basis changes (hence eta matrices) since the
		the basis was last factored. Used to schedule periodic
		factoring of the basis. Reset to 0 each time the basis is
		factored.
    pivs        The number of basis pivots since entry into a primal or dual
		simplex phase (excludes bound-to-bound simplex `pivots').
		Used when deciding whether to remove variables from the pivot
		reject list, and whether to pop out of a simplex phase due to
		excessive swing.
    dinf	Number of successive refactors with dual infeasibility.
		Cleared at the start of a simplex phase.
		Incremented/cleared in dy_accchk iff a dual feasibility check
		is performed.

  degen		Activation level of antidegeneracy algorithm. Held at 0 when
		the antidegeneracy algorithm is not active. Incremented each
		time a restricted subproblem is formed, and decremented when
		the restriction is backed out. (Values > 1 indicate that
		degeneracy recurred while working on a restricted subproblem,
		resulting in further restriction.)
  degenpivcnt	The number of successive degenerate pivots.

  idlecnt	The number of cycles since the objective has changed.

  lastz		Previous objective value for various activities; used to
		detect and suppress loops.
    piv		  Objective at last pivot (detects stalling)
    cd		  Objective at last entry into constraint deactivation
		  (dyPURGECON) (detects constraint activate/deactivate loops)
    vd		  Objective at last entry into variable deactivation
		  (dyPURGEVAR) (detects variable activate/deactivate loops)
    fp		  Objective at last entry into force primal (dyFORCEPRIMAL)
		  (detects constraint activate/deactivate loops)
    fd		  Objective at last entry into force dual (dyFORCEDUAL)
		  (detects variable activate/deactivate loops)

  prim		Primal variable information
    norm1	  1-norm of basic primal variables inv(B)b
    norm2	  2-norm of basic primal variables
    max		  inf-norm (max) of basic primal variables
    maxndx	  index of max primal variable

  dual		Dual variable information
    norm1	  1-norm of dual variables c<B>inv(B)
    norm2	  2-norm of dual variables
    max		  inf-norm (max) of dual variables
    maxndx	  index of max dual variable

/*
  Declarations global to the dylp implementation but not visible outside of
  it. With this we can avoid passing huge numbers of parameters and/or
  unpacking a structure on a regular basis. Unless otherwise indicated, indices
  are in the dy_sys (active system) frame of reference.

  Main structures
  ---------------
  dy_lp:	The lp control structure for dylp.
  dy_sys:	The active constraint system; initialised in dylp:startup
  dy_tols:	Tolerances in effect for dylp; initialised in
		dylp:dylp from orig_tols.
  dy_opts:	Options in effect for dylp; initialised in
		dylp:dylp to point to same structure as orig_opts.
  dy_stats	Statistics structure for dylp; initialised in dylp:dylp to
		point ot the same structure as orig_stats.

  Constraint & Variable Management
  --------------------------------
  dy_actvars:	The active variables. Indexed in dy_sys frame, contains
		indices in orig_sys frame. Attached to dy_sys.
		Entries for logical variables (1 <= j <= concnt) are
		meaningless.
  dy_actcons:	The active constraints. Indexed in dy_sys frame, contains
		indices in orig_sys frame. Attached to dy_sys.
  dy_origvars:  Status of the original architectural variables. If the
		variable is active, the entry contains the index of the
		variable in the dy_sys frame. If the variable is inactive,
		the coding is the negative of the vstat flags, limited to
		the nonbasic status values vstatNBFR, vstatNBFX, vstatNBLB,
		or vstatNBUB.  Indexed in orig_sys frame. Attached to orig_sys.
  dy_origcons:	Status of the original constraints; contains 0 if inactive,
		otherwise the index of the constraint in the dy_sys frame.
		Indexed in orig_sys frame. Attached to orig_sys.
  
  Basis Management
  ----------------
  dy_basis:	The basis vector. Indexed by basis position, attached to
		dy_sys.
  dy_var2basis:	Translates a variable index to a basis pos'n. Indexed by
		column, attached to dy_sys. Entries for nonbasic variables
		must be kept at 0.
  dy_status:	The status vector. Indexed by column, attached to dy_sys.
  
  Primal and Dual Variables
  -------------------------
  dy_x:         The values of all primal variables. Indexed by column,
		attached to dy_sys. Values of nonbasic variables must always
		be correct (to allow uniform handling of normal nonbasic
		variables and superbasic variables). Values of basic
		variables will retain unperturbed values while the
		antidegeneracy mechanism is active -- this allows the
		perturbation to be quickly backed out.
  dy_xbasic:	The values of the basic variables. Indexed by basis pos'n,
		attached to dy_sys.
  dy_y:         The dual variables. Indexed by basis pos'n, attached to
  		dy_sys.

  Projected Steepest Edge (PSE) Pricing
  -------------------------------------
  dy_cbar:	Iteratively updated vector of reduced costs. Indexed by column,
		attached to dy_sys.
  dy_gamma:	Iteratively updated vector of column norms ||abar<j>||^2.
		Indexed by column, attached to dy_sys.
  dy_frame:	Boolean vector which indicates if a given variable is in the
		current frame of reference. Indexed by column, attached to
		dy_sys.
  
  Dual Steepest Edge (DSE) Pricing
  --------------------------------
  dy_rho:	Iteratively updated vector of row norms ||beta<i>||^2.
		Indexed by basis position, attached to dy_sys.

  DSE pricing also makes use of dy_xbasic (the reduced costs of the dual
  variables), and maintains dy_cbar.
  
  Antidegeneracy
  --------------
  dy_brkout:    Specifies the direction a variable needs to move to escape
		from a degenerate vertex.  Indexed by basis pos'n, attached
		to dy_sys.
  dy_degenset:  Specifies the set of constraints (equivalently, basic
		variables) perturbed at each level of the antidegeneracy
		algorithm. Indexed by basis pos'n, attached to dy_sys.  The
		entry for a constraint is the highest level of degenerate set
		which includes the constraint. If the entry is 0, the
		constraint is not involved in degeneracy.
  dy_ddegenset:	Specifies the set of dual constraints (equivalently, reduced
		costs) perturbed at each level of the antidegeneracy
		algorithm. Indexed by variable index, attached to dy_sys.
		The entry for a dual constraint is the highest level of
		degenerate set which includes the constraint. If the entry is
		0, the constraint is not involved in degeneracy.
