  The Theory: quiet_nan is used to indicate failure (by returning NaN)
  without triggering a signal the client may not be prepared to catch. The
  idea is that any reasonable checks in the client will detect NaN fairly
  quickly.  signalling_nan is used when there's no advantage in delaying a
  signal.
 
  The Reality: Neither seems to trigger a signal, and many computing
  environments can't tell the difference. But it's coded into dylp, and it'd
  be much ado to change. Hence the compile-time ugliness that follows.
 
  In the Sun Workshop environment, quiet_nan and signalling_nan are declared
  in sunmath.h and found in libsunmath. With release 5.0, sunmath.h includes
  some declarations of type `long long', which isn't supported under the -Xc
  (strict ANSI compatibility) option for cc. So, we extract only the
  definitions we need.  Unfortunately, sunmath.h is present only in the Sun
  Workshop programming environment. Sun without Workshop has only the
  require file nan.h, which is inadequate.
 
  For a long while, GNU C didn't distinguish QNaN and SNaN. More recently,
  its support for IEEE 754 seems to have improved, but it's not clear that we
  can count on everyone having a recent GCC environment just yet. Here, too,
  nan.h is inadequate.  The easy way out is to simply #define them as macros
  that return the proper bit pattern. Arguably this would make more sense in
  general than Sun's implementation as functions.
 
  According to IEEE 754, the proper bit patterns are:
 
    0x7ff00000 00000000                  for Inf
    0x7fffffff ffffffff                  for QNaN
    0x7ff00000 00000001                  for SNaN
   
  It works this way: The IEEE definition of NaN is
    Bits         Value
    63                  sign --- don't care for a NaN, but nice to be positive (0)
    62:52         exponent --- must be maximum value, 0x7ff
    51:0         fraction --- must not be zero (a fraction of zero is the
                  representation of infinity). Sun documentation defines QNaN
                  as having bit 51 of the fraction set to 1, SNaN as having
                  bit 51 set to 0.
 
  Creating the proper constants qualifies as a serious gross hack. And if you
  have a little-endian machine (the 80x86 family being far and away the most
  common example), you need to flip the byte order.
