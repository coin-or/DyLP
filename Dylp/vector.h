  Why, you might ask, are we including ctype.h? Well, it's required by the
  ANSI C specification, so it's pretty well guaranteed to exist. And, at least
  in Solaris and Linux environments that I'm familiar with, it'll pull in the
  compile-time symbols that specify big- or little-endian, which we really
  want.

  The Theory: quiet_nan is used to indicate failure (by returning NaN)
  without triggering a signal the client may not be prepared to catch. The
  idea is that any reasonable checks in the client will detect NaN fairly
  quickly.  signalling_nan is used when there's no advantage in delaying a
  signal.

  The Reality: Neither seems to trigger a signal, and many computing
  environments can't tell the difference. But it's coded into dylp, and it'd
  be much ado to change. Hence the compile-time ugliness that follows.

  In the Sun Workshop environment, quiet_nan and signalling_nan are declared
  in sunmath.h and found in libsunmath. With release 5.0, sunmath.h includes
  some declarations of type `long long', which isn't supported under the -Xc
  (strict ANSI compatibility) option for cc. So, we extract only the
  definitions we need.  Unfortunately, sunmath.h is present only in the Sun
  Workshop programming environment. Sun without Workshop has only the
  require file nan.h, which is inadequate.

  For a long while, GNU C didn't distinguish QNaN and SNaN. More recently,
  its support for IEEE 754 seems to have improved, but it's not clear that we
  can count on everyone having a recent GCC environment just yet. Here, too,
  nan.h is inadequate.  The easy way out is to simply #define them as macros
  that return the proper bit pattern. Arguably this would make more sense in
  general than Sun's implementation as functions.

  According to IEEE 754, the proper bit patterns are:

    0x7ff00000 00000000		for Inf
    0x7fffffff ffffffff		for QNaN
    0x7ff00000 00000001		for SNaN
  
  It works this way: The IEEE definition of NaN is
    Bits	Value
    63		sign --- don't care for a NaN, but nice to be positive (0)
    62:52	exponent --- must be maximum value, 0x7ff
    51:0	fraction --- must not be zero (a fraction of zero is the
		representation of infinity). Sun documentation defines QNaN
		as having bit 51 of the fraction set to 1, SNaN as having
		bit 51 set to 0.

  Creating the proper constants qualifies as a serious gross hack. And if you
  have a little-endian machine (the 80x86 family being far and away the most
  common example), you need to flip the byte order.

  In a Sun/Solaris environment, the definitions and functions that support
  IEEE floating point are in ieeefp.h. This seems to be true even if GNU
  compilers are being used instead of Sun Workshop compilers. In a GNU/Linux
  environment, the necessary definitions seem to live in math.h. The upshot
  is that we need to explicitly pull in ieeefp.h here for a Sun environment.

  For reasons that escape me (but likely have to do with compiling using strict
  ANSI compliance), in the Sun/Solaris environment the function isnan doesn't
  get declared from math.h. Declare it here.

  In a Microsoft environment the correct functions look to be _finite and
  _isnan from float.h.

  Sun/Solaris typedef's an enum, fpclass_t, for IEEE FP number classification
  codes, and bonsaiG and dylp expect to see it. GNU C gets clever, and uses
  an unnamed enum to create integer values for #define's of the
  classification symbols.  Pretty much everyone else sticks with simple
  #define's.

  Sun/Solaris names the classification function fpclass. Others call the
  function fpclassify.

  There's an uglier problem. Some environments (Sun, HP, for example) define
  10 FP number class codes, separating each major category (normalised, zero,
  infinity, denormalised) into two codes by sign and separating NaN into
  quiet and signalling NaN. GNU doesn't make this separation (a far more
  sensible approach in the case of sign, arguable for NaN).

  The approach taken here to deal with the problem is to redefine each pair
  of codes from the 10 code space to be one code from the 5 code space.  But
  you really have to be cognisant of the problem and code very carefully if
  you want to make explicit use of class codes in both environments. Try
  really hard to stick to functions like isnan, isinf, finite, etc.

  The only code you need for bonsai, under normal circumstances, is FP_QNAN.
  It's used in bound_utils.c.
