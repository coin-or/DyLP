  Function to search a hash table for the first occurence of a particular key.
  The hash index is calculated to get to the proper bucket, then the linked

  recently installed entry for the key is the one found. Since one might use
  this routine to see if something is in the table, it doesn't complain if the
  entry isn't found.

  Parameter:
    key:	character string to be looked up
    hashtab:	hash table to be searched
    size:	number of buckets in the hash table

  Returns: entry associated with the key, or NULL if nothing is found
