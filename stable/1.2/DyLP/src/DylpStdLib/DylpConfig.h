  Include file for the configuration of Dylp.

  On systems where the code is configured with the configure script (i.e.,
  compilation is always done with HAVE_CONFIG_H defined), this header file
  includes the automatically generated header file config_dylp.h, then
  undefines macros that might configure with other ProjConfig.h files.

  On systems that are compiled in other ways (e.g., with the Developer
  Studio), the header file configall_system.h is included to define those
  macros that depend on the operating system and the compiler, followed by
  the defines used for configuration of dylp. A user can modify the default
  settings by editing this file.
